    paragraph: `Home security systems, sometimes referred to as alarm systems, come in many shapes and sizes. However, all of them have one goal in common: to help protect you, your home, and your loved ones from break-ins. Usually, a home alarm system will consist of a central hub or control panel that acts as the “brains” of your system, as well as a series of sensors designed to detect intruders if they attempt to enter your home. We specialize in integrating a variety of smart products and safety systems to make your home more secure. Our fully integrated systems combine keyless entry, video intercoms, sensors and cameras to give you ‘master control’ over your entire home right on your smartphone. We can integrate your alarm system as well for total peace of mind no matter where you are.`,

    paragraph: `Think of a home security system like a homeowner’s insurance policy. Like homeowners insurance, a home alarm system is something you hope you’ll never have to use, but if the need ever arises, you’ll sure be glad you have it. This is especially the case when you consider that a home security system can help protect you and your family from much more than just potential home invasions. Depending on the equipment you select, your system may also help alert you and local emergency services in the event of a fire, a flooding basement, or dangerous levels of carbon monoxide. If you have elderly loved ones living with you, your system may even include a panic button or life-alert pendant. These devices are particularly handy in the event of an accidental fall or similar emergency, when your loved one might not be able to reach a phone and call for help. In addition, if your security system integrates with your smartphone or other smart home devices, you can even use it to do things like see who’s at the front door via a surveillance camera, or unlock the door for your kids remotely when they get home from school.`,
